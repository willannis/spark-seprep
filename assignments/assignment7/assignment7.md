# Assignment 7 Podman AI Lab

## Run an LLM powered application locally

Follow the directions from the Podman AI Lab documentation to [start a chatbot recipe](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/ai-lab/start-recipe).
You can choose any recipe from the `Recipe Catalog`. The `Chatbot` and `Summarizer` will use the same model downloaded in class, `instructlab/granite-7b-lab-GGUF`.
The `Codegen` recipe will by default use a model from HuggingFace that was fine-tuned for code generation. It's recommended to choose one of these 3
options.

The documentation view of AI Lab is slightly different than the most up-to-date version you all have on your laptops, but you should be able to easily
deduce how to launch a recipe by finding the `More Details` -> `Start` button.

Chat with your application from your local browser. Take a screenshot of some history of your interaction with the chatbot.

Save your screenshot in a new markdown file, and create a `Pull Request` that adds your file in the `spark-seprep/assignments/assignment7` folder of
this repository. Along with your markdown file, you'll also need to upload the image it references. Add your image to the `assignment7/images` folder.

In your markdown file, you'll do something like [this example](./sally-omalley.md)

```

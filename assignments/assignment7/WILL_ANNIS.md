## I ran the Chatbot
Here is my Chatbot Screenshot

#### What went well:
I felt like the chatbot gave me some very descriptive answers and clearly explained what it could and could not to. I also gave me suggestions for what to ask it if it could not do the task I asked it to do which was very helpful. I gave in depth answers and I felt like it took away any confusion of indecisiveness I would've had when choosing what to ask it next.

#### What didn't go well
The chatbot was veryyy slow. I felt like it took forever to answer and it did not have the capability to answer my first few questions which was a little annoying because I waited so long for the answer. Although it was nice that the answers were so in depth, it made the chatbot take even longer to run. I think I should've asked it some more baseline questions that it would not need any computation skills to solve or current knowledge.
